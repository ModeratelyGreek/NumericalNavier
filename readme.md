# Setup:
- Clone the repo
- Make a folder for yourself
- Work rather strictly within that folder. If you intend to use someone else's work or modify it, do so by branching I guess, but optimally just make a copy of their work in a notebook of your own
- If using vscode, consider using the extension profile in MichaelFolder > julia-notebook.code-profile. Import it by clicking the vscode gear (lower left corner) > profile > import

- Get stoked.
